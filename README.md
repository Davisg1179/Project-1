Disney Company Analysis
Questions to be answered:
Does the current stock price of Disney represent an under-valuation or over-valuation of the company? 
Do the financial metrics (PE ratio, price to sales , price to book, net profit margin current ratio, debt to equity, debt to assests, gross profit,  and ROE) support the current or projected stock price of Disney?
What does the valuation of the company look like doing a 5 year discounted cash flow (DCF) model of the company look like considering pessimistic, neutral, and optimistic scenarios? 
Does the Monte Carlo simulation of the 5 year outlook for the stock price support the conclusions gained from the DCF model? 
 
 Current Ratio- Liquidity ratio that measures whether a firm has enough resources to meet its short-term obligations between 1.5 & 3%. The likely hood a company will pay the investor back.


Debt to Assets Ratio - It can be interpreted as the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt. Anything higher than 1 shows that a most of the assets that are financed by debt.


Debt to Equity Ratio- Indicates the relative proportion of shareholders’ equity and debt used to finance a company’s assets. The average is about 1.5%.

Gross Profit Margin Ratio- Shows the percentage of sales revenue a company keeps after it covers all direct costs associated with running the business. A higher gross profit margin, means the company has more cash to pay for indirect and other costs such as interest and one-time expenses. 65% is healthy. For every dollar generated means that is the percentage retained while the rest is used for cost.

Return On Equity Ratio - the rate of return that the owners of common stock of a company receive on their shareholdings. Return on equity signifies how good the company is in generating returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. 15-20% is considered good.

Price To Sales Ratio – Compares the company’s stock price to revenue. A ratio less than 1.0 means it is a better investment.

Price To Earnings Ratio - Valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings. High P/E ratio means a company is overvalued. Average is 12-15.

Price To Book Ratio- Any value under 1.0 is considered a good P/B value, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. Average is under 3.0.

Net Profit Margin Ratio - How much net income is generated as a percentage of revenues received. Net profit margin helps investors assess if a company's management is generating enough profit from its sales and overhead costs are being contained. 10% is average

Monte Carlo Simulation - Performs risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values—a probability distribution—for any factor that has inherent uncertainty. It then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions.

Conclusion- Based on the analysis of the financial ratios and the various valuation methods, we think the current stock price of Disney is neither under- or over-valued.  Market and economic conditions will change going forward, but at this time we think it's a sound investment.
